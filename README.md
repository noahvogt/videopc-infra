## Security Considerations

- boot security
    - add BIOS password
    - use motherboard with TPM2.0 and BIOS password not stored in volatile memory
    - use secure boot
    - use full disk encryption with TPM keys
    - disable unneeded device ports in BIOS
- prevent user input
    - blacklist all HID modules
        - usb
        - serial decies /dev/tty* (or more fine-grained) using a udev rule
    - disable unneeded device ports in software
- prevent leakage through network
    - use https
        - use a self-signed certificate as to not worry about expiration
    - use firewall to block all ports except the two needed
- vulnerabilty exploits
    - reduce software stack
    - apply some hardening
    - add update schedule
